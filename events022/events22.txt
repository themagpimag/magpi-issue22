This free tutorial will explore how to program using Python by making games. We will start with learning Python's simple data types, including numbers, letters and strings, and lists. We will also explore comparisons, if-statements, and loops. Finally, we will combined our new knowledge by creating our own game using the PyGame library.

Sunday, April 27, 2014 from 2:00 PM to 4:00 PM (EDT)
Beachwood, OH
Don't think a credit-card sized computer can do much? Guess again. Campers will use a computer called Raspberry Pi to do computer animations, design games, and make simple window applications. Participants work in teams of two. These "Beta" workshops are designed to assure that kids will have a fun/educational time where it will encourage "creative thinking." in the child.

How do you fancy finding out how some simple programming using a bit of code and a cheap computer (called the Raspberry Pi for those of you wondering) with some old robots or junk we've/you've got knocking about can make your old bot learn new tricks?
We're delighted to be joined by the very imaginative Adam Clarke who loves craft, technology, coding, and bringing people of all ages together to make bonkers bots. He was recently shortlisted for the Tate Britain I K Prize for exceptional talent in the digital industry, he has over 20 years experience of engaging people in creative digital practice.
