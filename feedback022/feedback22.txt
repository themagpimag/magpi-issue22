Hello,

I just wanted to let you know that I really enjoyed Martin Hodgson’s Python
port of Strongholds of the Dwarven Lords that was in the recent issue of The
MagPi. I plan on sharing it with some of my more advanced gifted middle school
students.  Please continue to include Python programs like this in your
magazine.  It’s nice to be able to do cool things with the Raspberry Pi
without needing to purchase hardware or having the needed knowledge to make it
work.  I hope to see more of Martin’s submissions in future issues!

Thanks!

Hi MagPi,

Really enjoyed this issue - thank you very much!

I particularly liked the type-in, oh the memories... Anyway, as per normal, it
did not work first time - never had one that did way back then either on my
Amstrad. I have enjoyed fixing it. 

Keep up the good work.

Kind regards,

Ian Neill
