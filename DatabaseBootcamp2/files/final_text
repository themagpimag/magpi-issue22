It is easier to explain this table in conjunction with the next command.  This shows you how to insert data. :-
<<insert magpi20.png>>
So let’s now examine these two commands. The INSET INTO command can be entered on a single line but it has been laid out here for clarity.It should be clearer to see that the table called ‘birdtable’ now has a row (or records) containing:-

           “Fred” in first_name.
          “Epping” in town
          19571016 in dob (date of birth)  
                   ie 16th October 1957 and 
           3  goes into birds.

Note the way data is entered.  Text is surrounded by quotation marks,  date is entered in the yyyymmdd format and numbers (integers) are just entered directly as numbers. Each value is separated by commas.  This is what the table was programmed to accept in the CREATE TABLE command.  
<<insert magpi20a.png>>
Try adding a few more lines of data of your own.  

Top-tip: It is quicker to press the up arrow key, to recall and edit the previous line and press enter again.  This save typing the whole line particularly as the rest of the command remains unchanged.

Also note that MySQL confirmations each entry with a line about the number of rows affected. 

Confirm your table is being built by entering 
<<insert magpi21.png>>
Two useful database functions are sorting and searching.  Let’s try some examples.

Viewing the data – sorting
Try sorting by entering:-
<<insert magpi22.png>>

To see everything sorted by first name and
<<insert magpi23.png>>

To sort the same list but this time by the descending number of birds.

Viewing the data - searching
* was introduced as a ‘wild card’ meaning anything or everything there are two others wild cards. These are % (percent) and _ (underscore).  Where * meant any or all % means part and _ means one element. Try them out by entering
<<insert magpi24.png>>

To see everything where the whole name is Fred and

<<insert magpi25.png>>
<<insert magpi26.png>>

To catch every option (if they existed) Frad, Frbd, Frcd, Frdd, Fred, Frfd …… Frzd etc … and

<<insert magpi27.png>>

With any name with an r in it. Also 
<<insert magpi28.png>>

With any name with a letter r in it

Logical
Two ‘logical’ words that can be included in SQL statements are AND and OR.  AND meaning both conditions need to qualify OR means either condition needs to apply. Try commands like:-
<<insert magpi29.png>>

To find names with r in AND birds greater than 3. 
<<insert magpi30.png>>
to find Freds OR entries with birds less than 3.

More selective
In every example above we have printed out all of the fields for each selected record.  We can be more selective by typing:-
 
<<insert magpi31.png>>

Notice here how the order by option can be added to build even bigger SQL commands.

Conclusion
There is a lot to be gained by testing these commands on your Pi.  Working in text mode is a rapid way of learning, testing, building and repairing databases as well as being a fundamental computing skill. 
 
Homework
Two fields that were included here but not discussed were ‘id’ and ‘record’.
Record automatically entered a timestamp when a new record was entered.  Id was used as a ‘key’ field automatically entering a unique number for every new line. Investigate these.

In the next artocle we will see how to display these results on the web.
